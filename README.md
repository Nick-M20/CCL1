## ✍️ **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:** I tried  to make something different and challenging and it went quite well
- **Core Mechanics:** The Laser reflects very well and realistic, the physics of the mirrors is perfect and I learned something new.

### Challenges:
- **Aspirations vs Reality:** I had bigger asiprations from me and I wantd to do more but I didn t have enough time and resources.
- **Bug Fixes:** Handling  the mirrors and makeing them work was a bit tricky.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Time Management:** Managing time and I have to learn to plan my steps better.
- **Keep it Simple:** Next time I will try to keep things more simple and easier for me understand.
